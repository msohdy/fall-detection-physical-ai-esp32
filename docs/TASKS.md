# Fall Detection System — Build & Open-Source Task List

2026-09-17 · @u_Gd73xkkFmo9snIgr0fdFzg

## Overview

This is the execution checklist for the Fall Detection & Alert System PRD: a room/wearable ESP32-S3 device that classifies body state from an MPU6050 and sends a Telegram alert on a confirmed fall. Work through the seven phases in order — each one hands off what the next needs (wiring before firmware, trained model before flashing, working device before writing it up).

Each task below is a checkbox. As you close a task, capture what you'd tell someone reproducing this from scratch (settings used, gotchas hit, screenshots to take) — that running log becomes the open-source README, so document as you go rather than after the fact.

**Phases**

1. Project setup (PlatformIO + repo scaffolding)
2. GitHub project setup (repo, Issues, Projects board, milestones)
3. Wiring (diagram tools + physical build)
4. TinyML data collection & training (Edge Impulse)
5. Firmware coding & pin configuration
6. Build, flash & upload
7. Testing & validation
8. Documentation & open-source release

## Phase 1 — Project Setup

- [x] Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) as a VS Code extension (free, open source) — install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) first if you don't have it, then add the PlatformIO IDE extension from the marketplace
- [x] Create a new PlatformIO project — **deviation:** created via the PlatformIO "New Project" wizard with `board = esp32s3usbotg`, framework = `arduino`. Note this is technically Espressif's official ESP32-S3-USB-OTG devkit board *definition* (LCD + 4 buttons), not an exact match for the actual hardware (a generic ESP32-S3-N16R8 dev board, confirmed via `esptool flash_id`: ESP32-S3, 16MB quad flash, 8MB quad PSRAM). Kept as-is by choice — pin-mapping mismatches from this will need attention once Phase 3 wiring starts referencing board-specific pin macros.
- [x] Confirm the board builds and uploads a blank sketch before touching sensors — build + upload over USB confirmed working (COM8, native USB on `VID:PID=303A:1001`). Serial output verification was skipped for now (the wizard's default `main.cpp` doesn't call `Serial.begin()`/print anything) — revisit once `main.cpp` actually needs serial output. Note: this board's native USB port required boot to actually route Arduino's `Serial` there in earlier testing; if serial output looks silent later, check whether `-DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1` is needed in `build_flags`.
- [x] Set up the repo structure for open-sourcing from day one:
  - `/src` — firmware (`main.cpp`, state machine, drivers)
  - `/include` — headers (pin map, config constants)
  - `/lib` — the Edge Impulse exported library (added in Phase 3)
  - `/docs` — wiring diagrams, photos, this task list exported as the README
  - `/data` — sample IMU captures (small representative samples only — raw training data usually stays out of git; note where the full dataset lives)
  - `/test` — added automatically by the PlatformIO wizard (PlatformIO Unity test runner scaffold); not in the original plan but harmless, left in place
  - `platformio.ini` — board, framework, and library dependencies pinned to versions
- [x] Add a `.gitignore` for PlatformIO (`.pio/`, `.vscode/` build artifacts) — used PlatformIO wizard's auto-generated `.gitignore`
- [x] Initialize the git repo and pick an open-source license (MIT or Apache-2.0 are the common defaults for hobbyist hardware projects) — **chose MIT**, copyright line uses the `msohdy` git identity rather than a legal name (fine for an open-source hobby project); added `LICENSE` and a stub `README.md`
- [x] Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and note the bot token + your chat ID — done; token/chat ID currently saved in a local `.env` (now git-ignored) as personal notes. **Note:** `.env` is not read by the firmware — Arduino/PlatformIO can't load it at compile or run time without custom build scripting. Per the PRD, the actual values will move into `include/secrets.h` (a git-ignored C++ header, with a `secrets.h.example` template committed) when Telegram integration is coded in Phase 5.

## Phase 2 — GitHub Project Setup

- [x] Create the GitHub repo (public, since this is going open source) and push the local repo from Phase 1 as the initial commit — created via `gh repo create`: [msohdy/fall-detection-physical-ai-esp32](https://github.com/msohdy/fall-detection-physical-ai-esp32)
- [x] Add repo topics/tags for discoverability (`esp32`, `tinyml`, `edge-impulse`, `fall-detection`, `platformio`)
- [x] Enable GitHub Issues and set up labels that map to this checklist's structure — **deviation:** used `phase-1-setup` through `phase-8-docs` (8 phases, not 7 — matches the actual phase count in this file) plus the repo's default `bug`/`help wanted` labels
- [x] Create a GitHub Project (the built-in Projects board) with columns `Backlog / In Progress / Done` — [Fall Detection Build Roadmap](https://github.com/users/msohdy/projects/3). **Deviation:** one issue per phase (not one per task) was added to the board, each issue linking back to its section of this file for the detailed checklist — keeps the board readable while this file stays the source of truth for task-level detail.
- [x] Set milestones matching the phases, each with its issue attached — 8 milestones created matching the 8 phases in this file
- [ ] Add a `CODEOWNERS` or at least a note in `README.md` on who reviews PRs — **explicitly deferred** to closer to Phase 7/8, per plan
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Discussions — **explicitly deferred** until the project has outside visitors

## Phase 3 — Wiring

**Free/open-source tools to design and document the diagram**

- [x] [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) — **chosen primary tool** (switched from an initial Wokwi choice): open source, breadboard-style diagram, parts easy to find in Fritzing's library
- [x] [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) — considered first, not used
- [x] [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) — not needed for this project (no PCB planned for v1)
- [x] Pick one primary tool for the repo — **Fritzing** (deviation from the earlier Wokwi decision, made once actually building the diagram)

**Pin table** — **deviation:** the Neopixel is the board's onboard single WS2812 RGB LED (GPIO48), not an external strip, so there's no separate strip wiring or level-shifting concern.

| Signal | MPU6050 | Neopixel (onboard) | Buzzer (active) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power | VCC → 3.3V | onboard, no wiring | + → **GPIO6** (switched power, not a fixed rail) |
| Ground | GND → GND | onboard | - → GND |
| Data/Signal | SDA → GPIO8 | GPIO48 (onboard) | *(none — see note below)* |
| Clock | SCL → GPIO9 | — | — |

- [x] Confirm your board's default I2C pins — **GPIO8 (SDA) / GPIO9 (SCL)**, the Arduino-ESP32 core's default `Wire.begin()` pins on ESP32-S3 (no strapping-pin conflicts), set explicitly rather than relying on board defaults since the board ID in `platformio.ini` doesn't exactly match the physical hardware
- [x] Confirm the buzzer type (passive vs active) — **confirmed active** via direct test: connecting VCC to 3.3V and GND with the third pin left unwired produced a steady, continuous tone, meaning it has its own internal driver circuit. This corrects an earlier passive guess based on an old, apparently-unrelated sample sketch that used `tone()`.
  - **Deviation — no dedicated signal pin:** this buzzer's 3rd pin turned out to be unused (confirmed: it buzzed with just VCC+GND wired, 3rd pin floating). There's no logic-level control input at all — the module just turns on whenever it has power. So control works by switching **power itself**: the wire originally planned for a fixed 3.3V rail instead goes to **GPIO6**, which sources power to the buzzer directly; GND stays on GND; the 3rd/mid pin is left disconnected. Driver code in Phase 5 uses `digitalWrite(GPIO6, HIGH/LOW)` to turn it on/off — confirmed working.
  - **Note for Phase 5:** driving the buzzer directly off a GPIO (rather than through a transistor) works for bring-up but isn't the most robust long-term design if the buzzer's current draw is on the high side for a GPIO pin (ESP32-S3 GPIOs recommend staying under ~20mA). Revisit with a transistor driver if it proves unreliable.
  - **PRD implication to revisit in Phase 5:** the PRD's per-state buzzer table calls for a distinct *tone* per concerning state (warning tone / siren / recovery chirp). An active buzzer can't vary pitch — only on/off timing patterns. Will need to use distinct *beep patterns* (e.g. different on/off rhythms) instead of distinct pitches to keep the "tell severity apart by sound alone" requirement.
- [x] Note the Neopixel strip's logic voltage — **N/A**, onboard single LED (GPIO48), not an external strip

**Physical build**

- [x] Breadboard the MPU6050, Neopixel, and buzzer per the diagram — done one component at a time, each verified with a real firmware test rather than just continuity: MPU6050 confirmed via I2C scanner (responds at `0x68`), buzzer confirmed via `digitalWrite` on/off toggling on GPIO6, Neopixel confirmed via a red/green/blue color-cycle test on GPIO48
- [x] Photograph the breadboard from a few angles for the docs — one photo taken and added to `docs/wiring/wiringImage.jpg`
- [x] If building the wearable form factor, plan strain relief on the wires before final assembly — **decision: staying on breadboard for v1**, powered by a USB powerbank (handheld, not worn or room-mounted). No enclosure/form-factor commitment yet, so strain relief is out of scope for now; revisit if/when a final form factor is chosen.
- [x] Add the finished wiring diagram + photos + pin table to `/docs` — `docs/wiring/fall-detection-wiring.fzz` (Fritzing source), `docs/wiring/fall-detection-wiring.png` (exported diagram), `docs/wiring/wiringImage.jpg` (photo), pin table in this file and in `README.md`

## Phase 4 — TinyML Data Collection & Training

**Setup**

- [x] Create a free [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/) account and a new project
- [x] Flash a minimal sketch to the ESP32-S3 that reads MPU6050 accel + gyro and prints to serial in the format Edge Impulse's Data Forwarder expects — streams `accX,accY,accZ,gyrX,gyrY,gyrZ` at ~50Hz via raw I2C register reads (no Adafruit_MPU6050 library — an earlier attempt using that library appeared to hang/produce no serial output, and raw register access matching a previously-known-working sketch was used instead). Confirmed producing real, varying sensor values. Sample rate tuned from an initial ~100Hz down to ~50Hz (still dense enough to characterize a fall's acceleration spike within the PRD's ~1-2s window).
  - **Debugging note:** hit a confusing failure where I2C reads returned a fixed garbage value (`Wire.read()` returning -1 for every byte, i.e. `Wire.requestFrom()` failing) despite the MPU6050 previously scanning fine at `0x68`. Root cause turned out to be the **ESP32-S3 board itself not being fully seated in the breadboard** — some pins (including GPIO8/9) had no reliable contact. A lit power LED on the MPU6050 was a red herring: it stayed faintly lit even with VCC disconnected, due to current backfeeding through the I2C pull-up resistors on the breakout — lesson for later debugging: a lit sensor LED doesn't guarantee a solid power connection.
- [x] Connect the Data Forwarder and confirm live samples appear in the Edge Impulse Data Acquisition tab — **deviation (two levels deep):**
  1. `npm install -g edge-impulse-cli` failed (`@serialport/bindings` needs native compilation via `node-gyp`, which requires Visual Studio Build Tools that aren't installed — a large, slow install to add just for this).
  2. Edge Impulse Studio's browser-based WebSerial "Connect a new device" flow was tried as a CLI-free alternative, but turned out to require the device firmware to speak Edge Impulse's AT-command remote-management protocol (`Timeout when waiting for >` error) — a completely different thing from the plain-CSV Data Forwarder protocol our sketch speaks. Not usable without writing that protocol into the firmware.
  - **Final approach:** built a custom local tool, [`tools/serial-data-logger.html`](../tools/serial-data-logger.html) — a self-contained Web Serial page (no CLI, no special firmware protocol) that connects to the board, logs incoming CSV lines to an editable table, and exports a clean CSV per recording session. Those CSVs are then imported into Edge Impulse via Studio's **Data acquisition → Upload data** CSV wizard instead of a live Data Forwarder connection.

**Per-class collection** (5 classes: standing, sitting, walking, dizzy, fall)

- [x] Standing / sitting / walking — collected via `tools/serial-data-logger.html` (1399 / 1900 / 1971 samples respectively)
- [x] Dizzy/unsteady — simulated with deliberately irregular gait; 1886 samples
- [x] Fall — **deviation:** since the device is handheld (breadboard + powerbank, not worn — see Phase 3), falls are simulated by holding the assembly and mimicking the arm/body motion of falling (quick drop + sudden stop) rather than an actual worn fall onto a mattress; 960 samples (smallest class, as expected). **Known limitation carried into Phase 8 docs:** this fall signature is a proxy, not a real worn-device fall, and the model's confusion matrix shows real evidence of this (see below) — a handheld mimicked fall and a staggering "dizzy" motion end up looking more similar in the IMU signal than a real worn fall would.
- [x] After each recording session, reviewed samples for mislabeled segments using the chart + drag-select delete in `tools/serial-data-logger.html`. That tool later also gained a **Load CSV** button so already-saved recordings in `data/raw/` can be reopened for a second cleanup pass.

Total: 8116 raw samples across the 5 classes.

**Split & balance**

- [x] Checked class balance — fall (960) is the smallest class as expected, others range 1399–1971. No explicit rebalancing done; noted as something to revisit if fall-detection accuracy needs further improvement.
- [x] Train/validation split — 80/20, held out automatically by the training tool (see below) via a shuffled split of the windowed samples.

**Impulse design & training — deviation: Edge Impulse abandoned entirely**

Edge Impulse was dropped as the training platform (not just the data-forwarder connection method noted above). Reasons and what replaced it:

- [x] **Why:** wanted a fully local, reproducible, no-external-account training pipeline consistent with this project's "no external dependency" pattern (same reasoning as building `serial-data-logger.html` instead of relying on Edge Impulse's device-connection flow). Also, a simple 5-class dense-network classifier doesn't need Edge Impulse's Spectral Analysis / DSP blocks — raw windowed IMU samples fed directly into a small dense net work well here.
- [x] **Built [`tools/tinyml-trainer.html`](../tools/tinyml-trainer.html)** — a self-contained TensorFlow.js page: upload a CSV per class, configure window size / epochs / learning rate / model name, train a `dense(16, relu) → dense(8, relu) → dense(numClasses, softmax)` network entirely in-browser, then export a plain C header with the raw float weight/bias arrays (no TFLite Micro runtime needed — Phase 5 firmware will do a hand-rolled forward pass instead).
- [x] **Bug found and fixed during training:** the first training runs showed `val_acc` stuck around 0.3–0.5 and bouncing around while `acc` climbed normally to ~0.84 — classic overfitting-looking symptom, but the real cause was that the windowed dataset was built class-by-class in sequence (all "fall" windows, then all "sit", etc.), and TensorFlow.js's `validationSplit` carves its slice off the *end* of the array *before* any epoch shuffling. The validation set was therefore almost entirely just the last class or two, not a representative mix. Fixed by shuffling the windowed `(X, y)` pairs together before training. After the fix, `val_acc` tracked `acc` smoothly as expected.
- [x] **Added a confusion matrix to the trainer** (computed on the same validation slice tf.js uses internally) after realizing overall accuracy alone doesn't reveal whether "fall" specifically is being missed — which is exactly the PRD's stated priority. It also auto-flags in red if any "fall" validation samples were misclassified.
- [x] **Window size tuning — this mattered a lot.** Started at window=5 samples (100ms at 50Hz), which is far shorter than the PRD's suggested ~1–2s and produced heavy fall↔dizzy confusion (a 100ms slice can't capture a fall's actual shape). Iterated up:

  | Window size | Duration @ 50Hz | Overall val_acc | Fall samples missed |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 5 | 0.1s | ~0.87 (comparable to the very first Edge-Impulse-style attempt) | 68/209 (32.5%) |
  | 50 | 1.0s | 0.958 | 39/191 (20.4%) |
  | 75 | 1.5s | 0.963 | 23/205 (11.2%) — **accepted for now** |

  Fall↔dizzy remained the dominant confusion at every window size, consistent with the handheld-fall-simulation limitation noted above rather than being purely a hyperparameter problem.
- [ ] **Not fully met:** the PRD's "zero missed falls" bar is not actually hit — 11.2% of fall validation samples are still misclassified. Explicitly accepted as a known v1 limitation (to document plainly in Phase 8) rather than continuing to iterate indefinitely, given the handheld form factor is the more likely root cause at this point. Revisit if a wearable form factor or more/cleaner fall data becomes available.

**Export**

- [x] Final model: `include/fall_detection_model_data.h` — window=75 (450 input features = 75 samples × 6 channels), `dense(16)→dense(8)→dense(5)`, labels `fall, sit, stand, walk, dizzy`. No `/lib` dependency needed (no TFLite Micro) — Phase 5 firmware includes this header directly and implements the forward pass by hand.
- [x] Model version noted here: trained via `tools/tinyml-trainer.html`, window=75, 50 epochs, learning rate 0.001, final train acc 0.999 / val_acc 0.963 (see table above for the tuning history).

## Phase 5 — Firmware Coding & Pin Configuration

**Pin config**

- [x] Create `include/pins.h` with named constants for every pin used (I2C SDA/SCL = GPIO8/9, Neopixel = GPIO48 onboard, buzzer = GPIO6 switched power) — matches the pin table from Phase 3, so wiring changes only ever touch one file
- [x] Add library dependencies to `platformio.ini`: `Adafruit NeoPixel` (already added in Phase 3) and WiFi/HTTPS client (bundled with the ESP32 Arduino core). **Deviation from original plan:** no Edge Impulse export library and no MPU6050 driver library needed — see Drivers below.

**Drivers**

- [x] MPU6050 read loop — **deviation:** use the same raw I2C register access as `tools/mpu6050-data-forwarder.cpp` (registers 0x3B–0x48 via `Wire`), not the `Adafruit_MPU6050` library — an earlier attempt with that library hung with no serial output during Phase 4 bring-up, and the raw-register approach is already proven working at ~50Hz. Implemented in `include/mpu6050.h` + `src/mpu6050.cpp`, sampling at 50Hz into a 75-sample window (1.5s), matching exactly what `tools/tinyml-trainer.html` was trained on.
- [x] Model inference — **deviation:** no TFLite Micro. Implemented in `include/model_inference.h` + `src/model_inference.cpp` as a hand-rolled forward pass (`dense(450→16, ReLU) → dense(16→8, ReLU) → dense(8→5) → argmax`) over the raw float arrays in `include/fall_detection_model_data.h`.
  - **Gotcha hit and fixed:** `fall_detection_model_data.h` defines `LABELS[]` (and the weight/bias arrays) without `extern`, so including it directly from more than one `.cpp` file causes a linker "multiple definition" error — and would otherwise silently duplicate the model's ~160KB flash footprint per file that includes it. Fixed by making `model_inference.cpp` the *only* file that includes the generated header directly; everything else goes through `model_inference.h`, which mirrors the model's window-size/channel-count macros with a `static_assert` guard so a future retrain with different dimensions fails the build loudly instead of silently misbehaving.
  - **Confirmed working end-to-end** via a bring-up test: live MPU6050 samples → windowing → inference → predicted label printed over serial, producing sane results (mostly "sit" for a stationary device, as expected — no state-machine smoothing yet, so occasional single-frame noise is expected and will be handled by `CONFIRM_THRESHOLD` below).
- [x] Neopixel driver — `include/neopixel_driver.h` + `src/neopixel_driver.cpp`, a `VisualState` enum (`Standing/Sitting/Walking/Dizzy/Alarmed/Recovering`) with `neopixelSetState()` (called once on state change) and `neopixelTick()` (called every loop, non-blocking, drives the Alarmed pulse and Recovering amber→green fade off `millis()`). Confirmed all 6 states visually via a bring-up test.
- [x] Buzzer driver — **deviation:** buzzer is active with no signal pin (Phase 3) — driver is `digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH/LOW)` to switch its power directly, not `tone()`/`noTone()`. Implemented in `include/buzzer_driver.h` + `src/buzzer_driver.cpp` as a `BuzzerState` enum with distinct non-blocking on/off **beep patterns** per state (`Warning` = slow intermittent, `Siren` = fast continuous-feeling, `Recovery` = triple chirp + pause) instead of distinct tones. Confirmed audibly via the same bring-up test.

**State machine**

- [x] Implement the four states (NORMAL, DIZZY, ALARMED, RECOVERING) and transitions from the PRD's pseudocode/state diagram — `include/state_machine.h` + `src/state_machine.cpp`. Uses string comparison against `modelLabel()` rather than hardcoded class indices, so it stays correct even if the model is retrained with a different label order.
  - **Open issue found during live testing (deferred, not yet fixed):** ALARMED→RECOVERING was changed (by explicit choice) to require stand/dizzy/walk, excluding "sit". Live debug logging showed the model predicting "sit" for most of a real post-fall standing/walking attempt, which — combined with the sit exclusion — kept resetting the confirm counter and left the alarm stuck. Not a state-machine logic bug; the debug log confirmed the code does exactly what it's told. Likely fix: add "sit" back into the ALARMED-exit criteria (making it effectively "anything but a continued fall reading"), but left as-is for now per an explicit "optimize later" call — revisit before Phase 7 testing.
- [x] Implement `CONFIRM_THRESHOLD` and `RECOVER_CONFIRM_THRESHOLD` as sustained-reading counters, not single-frame triggers — `CONFIRM_THRESHOLD = 3` (~4.5s), `RECOVER_CONFIRM_THRESHOLD = 5` (~7.5s), counted in classifications at the ~0.67/sec (once per ~1.5s window) rate established below. (Initially set to 50/100 assuming a 50Hz classification rate; recalibrated after switching to non-overlapping-window classification — see the false-alarm fix below. Left as tunable constants for Phase 7 testing to adjust.)
- [x] **Deviation from the PRD's literal ALARMED exit condition:** by explicit choice, exiting ALARMED (siren stops, enters RECOVERING) now requires **stand, dizzy, or walk** — not the PRD's original "stand or sit." Any sign of movement/consciousness other than sitting still counts as recovering; a continued "fall" *or* "sit" reading keeps the siren going. RECOVERING → NORMAL (the final "all clear," which also sends the resolved Telegram message) still uses the original stand/sit criterion, unchanged.
- [x] Implement the ALARMED→RECOVERING→ALARMED relapse path (fall reading during RECOVERING jumps straight back to ALARMED and resets `alertSent` so a fresh Telegram message goes out)
- [x] **Real bug found during bring-up testing:** entering ALARMED on a single "fall" classification (as the PRD's pseudocode literally specifies) combined with classifying on a *sliding* window every new sample (~50Hz) caused spurious false alarms roughly every few seconds even at rest. The confusion matrix showed a small but nonzero false-fall rate (sit→fall, walk→fall, and especially dizzy→fall: ~1.2% of non-fall classifications overall) — at 50 classifications/second, that compounds to a ~46% chance of at least one false trigger per second. **Fixed without touching the single-frame-trigger logic**: switched from a sliding window (classify every sample) back to a fresh, non-overlapping window per classification (~0.67 classifications/sec) — this is also what the model was actually validated on (independent windows, not overlapping ones), and cuts the false-alarm rate to roughly once every couple of minutes. Neopixel/buzzer `tick()` calls still run every ~20ms during window collection so animations stay smooth despite the lower classification rate. Confirmed via a 35-second stationary test: zero false alarms.

**Telegram integration**

- [x] Store the bot token, chat ID, and WiFi credentials in a `secrets.h` that's git-ignored (never commit these) — `include/secrets.h` (git-ignored) + `include/secrets.h.example` (committed template). Chat ID was retrieved by messaging the bot once, then fetching `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and reading the `chat.id` field — the `.env` file from Phase 1 had saved the lookup *URL* instead of the actual numeric ID, so this had to be done properly here.
- [x] Implement `sendTelegramMessage()` as an HTTPS GET to the Bot API's `sendMessage` endpoint (`include/telegram.h` + `src/telegram.cpp`, using `WiFiClientSecure` + `HTTPClient`), called once on ALARMED entry (`alertSent` flag) and once on RECOVERING→NORMAL resolution. Returns `bool` (success/failure) rather than being fire-and-forget for the fall alert specifically — `alertSent` is only set `true` if the send actually succeeded, so it naturally retries on the next classification if WiFi wasn't ready yet, matching the PRD's pseudocode more precisely than an earlier draft that marked it sent unconditionally.
  - **Security note:** uses `WiFiClientSecure::setInsecure()` (no certificate pinning) — a common simplification for a hobbyist project, at the cost of no protection against a MITM on the local network. Documented in README's Build Log rather than silently done.
- [x] Make the WiFi/Telegram call non-blocking or at least short-timeout — `sendTelegramMessage()` checks `WiFi.status()` and returns immediately (no blocking wait) if not already connected; `telegramInit()`'s `WiFi.begin()` call itself is non-blocking (connects in the background). The actual HTTPS GET (only reached when already connected) has a 4-second timeout.
- [x] Wire it all together in `main.cpp`'s loop per the PRD pseudocode — confirmed working end-to-end: triggering a simulated fall produced a real Telegram message on-device.

## Phase 6 — Build, Flash & Upload

- [ ] `pio run` to compile — resolve any missing-library or pin-conflict errors before touching hardware
- [ ] Connect the ESP32-S3 over USB, confirm the correct serial port is detected (`pio device list`)
- [ ] `pio run --target upload` to flash; hold BOOT if your specific board needs manual bootloader entry (some ESP32-S3 boards auto-reset, others don't)
- [ ] Open the serial monitor (`pio device monitor`) and confirm sensor readings, inference output, and WiFi connection logs look sane before disconnecting from USB
- [ ] Do a first untethered test: battery power (if wearable) or wall power (if room device), confirm Neopixel/buzzer behavior matches expectations for a basic "standing still" baseline
- [ ] Note the exact `platformio.ini` board/framework versions that worked in `/docs` — ESP32 Arduino core version mismatches are a common source of "works for me" bug reports from people cloning the repo

## Phase 7 — Testing & Validation

Validate against the PRD's own success criteria:

- [ ] **Classifier accuracy** — re-check ≥90% on held-out data isn't just an Edge Impulse number; run live on-device with samples the model has never seen and log the confusion pattern, especially fall-vs-standing
- [ ] **End-to-end latency** — time from a simulated fall event to the Telegram message landing on a phone; target under \~5 seconds on stable WiFi. Log actual numbers across several trials, not a single run
- [ ] **Zero missed falls** — this is the PRD's explicit priority over false-positive rate. Run repeated fall simulations (forward/backward/sideways, different speeds) and treat any miss as a blocker, not a tuning footnote
- [ ] Test the WiFi-down path deliberately: confirm the local alarm (Neopixel + siren) still fires with WiFi disabled, and that the main loop doesn't stall waiting on the Telegram call
- [ ] Test the relapse path: trigger ALARMED → let it reach RECOVERING → trigger another fall before it reaches NORMAL, confirm it jumps back to ALARMED and sends a fresh alert
- [ ] Test recovery false-clear resistance: brief "standing" misreads during ALARMED should reset the confirm counter, not silence the alarm — deliberately inject a few noisy frames and confirm this holds
- [ ] If wearable: test battery life under continuous sampling + occasional WiFi bursts, and log it (open-source users will ask)
- [ ] Log every test run (setup, result, date) somewhere in `/docs` — this becomes the validation section of the writeup, not something to reconstruct from memory later

## Phase 8 — Documentation & Open-Source Release

- [ ] Write the README from the notes you've collected phase by phase — don't write it from scratch at the end: problem statement, BOM with links, wiring diagram + photos, setup instructions (PlatformIO, Edge Impulse), and a demo GIF/video of a simulated fall triggering the alert
- [ ] Publish the wiring diagram (Fritzing/Wokwi export) and pin table in `/docs`
- [ ] Document the dataset: class list, collection method per class, final sample counts, and either the exported dataset or clear instructions for reproducing it (raw motion data is usually fine to share; note any privacy considerations if it includes identifiable video/audio, which this project doesn't)
- [ ] Include the trained model export (or a link/version note if it's too large for git) so people can flash and test without retraining from zero
- [ ] Document known limitations plainly — false positive rate, what "dizzy" simulation doesn't capture about real dizziness, battery life if wearable, WiFi dependency for the remote alert — this is what separates a genuinely reproducible open-source project from a demo
- [ ] Add a CONTRIBUTING.md if you want outside contributions, and confirm the LICENSE file from Phase 1 is in place
- [ ] Do a final clean-clone test: pull the repo fresh on another machine (or ask someone else to), follow only the README, and see how far they get without asking you anything — fix whatever trips them up
- [ ] Publish: push to GitHub, write a short launch post (blog/LinkedIn/forum) summarizing the problem, the approach, and linking the repo and demo video
